# Natours

Natours is a fictional website that advertises nature tours. This landing page, along with its assets and theme, was designed by Jonas Schmedtmann. The final product was built by me. This project focuses on using CSS rather than JavaScript to flesh out a responsive, animated, and modern user interface.
